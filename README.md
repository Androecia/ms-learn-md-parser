# Microsoft Learn Markdown Parser
### Description

> *This is a brief summary provided by gpt, I will get around to writing this soon.*

This repository contains code for a parser that converts Microsoft Learn markdown format into tokens. The main struct is MsMarkdown, which contains a vector of MsMarkdownToken enums.

Each MsMarkdownToken represents a different type of element in the markdown document. For example, there are tokens for metadata, comments, headings, code blocks, tables and more.

The parser can be used to convert Microsoft Learn markdown documents into a structured format that can be easily manipulated and analyzed.


### This is Still Work In Progress
This is not a complete parser for the learn documents as noted by the 0.0.1 versioning.
It covers the main data structures of this format that relate to data structure documentation.


### Ms Markdown Syntax Reference
